Why NOT?
- Dynamic typing may not be for all
- Many dislike the s-expressions. Of course, they are WRONG.

Languages and their implementations
- Java/C/C++: Standards, many commercial implementations, high performance,
  industry support
- Haskell/Perl/Ruby/Python: Standards, ONE de-facto implementation, a few other
  implementations, large collection of portable libraries
- Javascript: Standards, several industry-backed implementations

=> Scheme: Standardized, NO de-factor implementation,
           about as many implementations as there are scheme programmers
           only ONE commercial implementation (chez)
